The styling is rendered through [foundation](https://get.foundation/) and [sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api), and the database is created and accessed using the [mysql2 NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and the [sequelize ORM](https://sequelize.org/). For further development, [node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/) with an npm install is required.

Below is our entity relationship diagram, or ERD. It shows all the relationships between the databases that Ality runs on and keeps track of. It even comes with our future goals. If you've got a good idea how to implement them, contact us!
