The styling is rendered through [foundation](https://get.foundation/) and [sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api), and the database is created and accessed using the [mysql2 NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and the [sequelize ORM](https://sequelize.org/). For further development, [node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/) with an npm install is required.
